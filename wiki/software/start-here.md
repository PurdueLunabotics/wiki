## Getting Started Flowchart

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Join the club and interested in software?] -- yes --> B[How experienced are you?];
    B -- Absolute Noob, what is code? --> C[Check out the docs!!!];
    B -- Got some coding experience --> C;
    B -- I coded the entire NASA Perseverance Rover from scratch--> C;
    A -- no --> Z[Check out the hardware teams]

```

> Moral of the above flowchart is that it doesn't matter how much experience you have, only difference is that those with more experience tend to have higher rates of progression (i.e learning is exponential with more experience)
